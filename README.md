# Pandas 2D slice translator (pd_2Dtranslate)
Translates Pandas 1D slice into Np 2D Array using basic list generation. Size of array is flexible as long as array can be filled by given Pandas slice.

Some tools require a 2D Np list and this was the quickest way to make lists in the format I desire.
